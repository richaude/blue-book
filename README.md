# About blue-book
This repository deals with implementing a search engine and GUI to search within a [UFO dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings#scrubbed.csv).  
## Using it
To execute it, you need to:
1. download the dataset.
2. compile `indexing.py`
3. execute `search.py "query"`, where `query` is the term you're looking for.
